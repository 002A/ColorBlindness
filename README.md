ColorBlindness - Color Blindness Library for [Processing](http://processing.org)
=============================================================

[Processing](http://processing.org) is a Java application popular with artists and creative technologists like myself. Processing allows users to build extensions to expand the application's features and to share those tools with the community.  I built this library to simulate Color Blindness.
